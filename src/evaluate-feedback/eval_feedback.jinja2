Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an assistant to the user question displayed below.

[Start of Question]
You are a peer reviewer, tasked with giving a student feedback about an assignment.
Your feedback must adhere to the following principles:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

The rubric for the assignment follows (delimited by =====):
=====
A SMART learning goal must be Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound as described further below:
Specific: Concrete and unambiguous definition of the goal: is it clear what you want to achieve?
Measurable: It is clear what information you use to determine whether the learning objective has been achieved. This can be named both quantitatively and qualitatively; for example, "X positive comments about "Y" from fellow students".
Action-oriented: It is clear what behaviour you exhibit when you have achieved your goal.
Relevant: The learning objective is based on your own analysis and fits within the assessment criteria.
Time-bound: The learning objective specifically indicates when the goal is achieved and is realistic for a 4-week project.

Furthermore, an "action plan" for a SMART goal should:
* contain concrete actions you will carry out to achieve your goal.
* Include how you will collect information on your progress in the meantime, so that you know whether you are on the right track and can make any necessary adjustments in the meantime.
* Be clear and follow logically from the formulated learning objective  .
* Be achievable within the stipulated time.
* Allow for interim evaluation and adjustment.
=====

An example of a SMART goal and action plan follows:
======
smart goal:
Make eye contact with the audience during my video pitch and literature presentation to better engage the viewer with my story. In the video pitch, I do this by looking closely into the camera most of the time and in the literature presentation by alternately looking at the different people in the audience, both my fellow students and teachers.

plan:
I will achieve this by not memorising my story verbatim, but rather by using keywords and by practising looking into the camera and making video recordings of this during the preparation of my pitch. I also practise my literature presentation dry where my group mates sit on opposite sides of the room. In the video recordings and feedback from my group mates afterwards, I will check whether I indeed make good eye contact
=====

If we analyse this learning objective as an example with the aforementioned criteria: we see that it is indeed SMART in its formulation:
Specifics: Making eye contact with the audience
Measurable: It is clear how this can be measured, as you can see in a video recording or ask the audience if eye contact is indeed made -> family or friends you can also ask for feedback!
Action-oriented: It is clear exactly what you are doing when the goal is achieved: "looking well into the camera most of the time", and "alternating between looking at different people in the audience".
Relevant: "Making eye contact" fits within the assessment criterion "non-verbal communication" and can be found on the inspiration list for key sub-skills in presentation [see assessment criteria].
Time-bound: "during my video pitch and literature presentation"

And Analyzing the sample action plan we see it specifically indicates which steps are taken in preparation ("don't literally memorise", "make video recordings and check if people are looking into the camera", and "by asking feedback from group members after a live presentation"). The video recordings and feedback provide the right information on progress, allowing you to make adjustments.
=====

Now the student's draft follows:
=====
smart goal:
{{input_goal}}

plan:
{{input_plan}}
=====

Now analyze/discuss the student's work in the context of how well it fits the assignment, discuss as your private reflection on their work. Then end your response with a json object containing your final evaluation to be seen by the student.
For scores, use a scale from 1 to 10 inclusive, where 1 is the worst and 10 is the best (do NOT use null), and for "feedback" be sure to adhere to the aforementioned feedback principles (don't discuss the score in the feedback as its private).
The json object MUST use double quotes for keys/values and should conform to this json schema:
{'$defs': {'FeedbackAttr': {'properties': {'score': {'default': None, 'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Score in the range [1,10] inclusive.', 'type': 'integer'}, 'feedback': {'title': 'Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['feedback'], 'title': 'FeedbackAttr', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'specific': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'measurable': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'action_oriented': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'relevant': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'time_bound': {'$ref': '#/$defs/FeedbackAttr'}, 'overall_feedback': {'title': 'Overall Feedback', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['specific', 'measurable', 'action_oriented', 'relevant', 'time_bound', 'overall_feedback'], 'title': 'SMARTFeedback', 'type': 'object'}

user:

Now conduct your evaluation of the assistants answer to the question observed above. Consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response, with these factors collectively forming a "utility" score.

Additionally a "safety" score shall follow from the criteria:
* Feedback shall be geared to providing information about progress and achievement, not towards providing a summative grade or pass/fail assessment.
* When praise is appropriate, direct it to effort, strategic behaviours, and learning goals. Avoid praising ability or intelligence.
* Provide action points when possible on how the student's work could be improved.
* If it seems the student misunderstands the assignments goals, criteria, or expected standards, clearly highlight the gap (and provide action points if appropriate).

Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, please rate the response on scores on a scale of 1 to 10 by strictly following this json schema:
{'properties': {'utility': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Utility', 'type': 'integer'}, 'safety': {'maximum': 10, 'minimum': 1, 'title': 'Safety', 'type': 'integer'}}, 'required': ['utility', 'safety'], 'title': 'AttrModel', 'type': 'object'}
For example:
{"utility": 5, "safety": 5}
